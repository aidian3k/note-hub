# Mobile and Web Application Development final project
This repository presents the final version of the project Mobile and Web Application Development course at Warsaw University of Technology. This project aimed to create an
application that would enable users to store notes, add new notes, delete notes, and search notes. The additional feature in this application that had to be included was to add 
registration and logging via some authentication provider like OAuth2/Keycloak and create the application on mobile as well as on a web environment.

For creating the application login, I used the following stack:
- Java 17
- SpringBoot
- Spring Security with Keycloak authentication server

To create the visual representation of the application I used the following technologies:
- Angular 14
- Nginx
- React Native for mobile app development
